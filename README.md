👕 Clothify v2.0
Clothify has been upgraded! What started as a static layout is now a fully functional frontend e-commerce application. This project demonstrates advanced DOM manipulation, state management using LocalStorage, and a modern, responsive UI with Dark Mode support.

🚀 Major Updates in v2.0
I have completely revamped the project to make it dynamic and interactive. The website now includes:

🌗 Dark/Light Mode: A persistent theme toggle that saves your preference.

🛒 Smart Cart System: Add items to the cart, update quantities, and remove items. Data persists even after refreshing the page (using localStorage).

🔍 Advanced Filtering: Search products by name, filter by category/price, and sort by price (Low to High / High to Low).

⚡ Quick View Modal: A detailed popup for every product with image gallery, color selection, and size options.

📱 Fully Responsive: Optimized for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop screens.

📩 Contact Page: A working contact form UI with toast notifications for user feedback.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Variables & Flexbox/Grid)

Logic: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) - No Frameworks used!

Icons: FontAwesome / Emoji

Storage: Browser LocalStorage API

📸 Features Overview
1. Dynamic Product Grid
Products are no longer hardcoded in HTML. They are rendered dynamically via JavaScript objects, making it easy to add or remove products from the code.

2. Shopping Cart Logic
Real-time total calculation.

Prevents duplicate items (increases quantity instead).

"Clear Cart" functionality.

3. Interactive UI Elements
Toast Notifications: Custom alerts when adding to cart or sending messages.

Image Gallery: Click on thumbnails in the modal to switch main images.

Color Swatches: Select product colors dynamically.
